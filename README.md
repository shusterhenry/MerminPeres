# MerminPeres

This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks that porvide a quantum solution to the Mermin-Peres magic square game.

Asher Baraban and I based this project on a nature physics paper by Bravyi et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0948-z#Fig2

We also used some code from collaborators with the writers of the paper. https://github.com/JanLahmann/Fun-with-Quantum#7-mermin-peres-magic-square-under-development
